# Draw Shapes Project

This is my first year comp sci project. Swiftbot (a raspberry pi robot) scans a QR code and decodes it when 'button A' is pressed. It moves to draw either a square or a triangle, based on the decoded text. When 'button X' is pressed, it creates a text file containing information about the shapes drawn. 

## How to compile and run the program?
#### Compile All Files Toegther: 
    javac -cp "SwiftBotAPI-5.1.0.jar" *.java
#### Run the Main File: 
    java -cp "SwiftBotAPI-5.1.0.jar": Main.java
